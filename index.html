                    I built this project in Java using the Eclipse IDE
                <br> for a networking class. Really I just wanted to get to program for my final project,
                <br> so I made this multiplayer game that implements a Java Server Socket. Then I uploaded it to the network VM
                <br> so I could play with other users on the VLAN!
                <br> It was my first forray in making a game, and probably the most impressive coding project I've made by myself.
                <br> There were a lot of questions without easy awnsers.
                <br> I also learned how useful git bash and bitbucket were for uploading a code project into a VM.

                I spent some time developing android projects under the instruction of my beloved professor Mark Jowett.
                <br> Android proved to be somewhat challenging to learn at first but eventually felt like second nature to me.
                <br> My flavor of Android development uses Java as the core language, which meant that working in android allowed 
                <br> me to sharpen my Java skills while also learning about development for a completely new platform.
                <br> I learned a great deal from a year of Android, and I believe it has strengthed my understanding of
                <br> both application, and web development.

           Hi this is a little game I wrote in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br>
           The goal is to blow up the alien invader by firing at him with *spacebar* <br>
